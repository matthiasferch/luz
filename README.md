Luz (pronounced [ˈluθ] or [ˈlus], Spanish for *light*) is a 3D game engine for the web, written from scratch in Typescript and WebGL 2.0. Its features include dynamic lighting and shadows, collision detection and response, visibility determination and space partitioning. 

It has no third-party dependencies apart from WebGL.
