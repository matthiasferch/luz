luz (pronounced [ˈluθ] or [ˈlus], Spanish for *light*) is a 3D game engine for the web, written from scratch in Typescript and WebGL 2.0. Its features include dynamic lighting and shadows, collision detection and response, visibility determination and hierarchical space partitioning. 

It has no run-time dependencies apart from WebGL.
